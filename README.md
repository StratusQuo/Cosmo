### Basic Form Filling

First, stage your Excel file:

### Interactive Options

When Cosmo encounters mismatches between your data and existing form values, it provides several options:

`s` - Skip the field
`a` - Append new value to existing
`o` - Overwrite existing value

For any option, you can add `all` to apply the same action to all remaining fields (e.g., `o all` will overwrite all fields)
